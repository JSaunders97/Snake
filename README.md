## Snake

A console-based version of the classic game Snake, built in C++ using object oriented programming.

# Build Instructions

I have inluded a ready built executable if you just want to test the game. However, if you'd prefer to build the project yourself there is a 'CMakeLists.txt' included, which the project can be built from using CMake. 

# Controls

Start the game by pressing enter. The arrow keys are used to control the snake's direction. Note that the snake cannot go back on itself. When the game ends, it can be restarted by pressing enter again or exited by pressing escape.
